## Interactions & Changes
In my personal code, I chose Time-Based to present my theme code. My code does not have any mouse or keyboard interaction.

My code was changed from the code in the group work. The groups of circles in the image are in constant motion. There are 12 groups of circles in total. When the 12th group of circles appears, the entire page is refreshed.
