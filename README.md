## Interactions & Changes
In my personal code, I chose Time-Based to present my theme code. My code does not have any mouse or keyboard interaction.

My code was changed from the code in the group work. The groups of circles in the image are in constant motion. There are 12 groups of circles in total. When the 12th group of circles appears, the entire page is refreshed.

## Inspiration
My inspiration when it comes to geometric combinations. I saw a video on youtube. It shows small circles in a large circle making regular movements. My theme is Time-Based and in order to compound the theme better, I set the circles to 12 corresponding to 12 hours. When the time is up, they will be refreshed together. I kept the white dot background from the group work. I changed the colour of each circle in the group enough to be random. Each time it refreshes there will be a regular group of 12 circles and a different colour. The white dots in the white dot background will refresh in different positions along with it.

When this theme was given to me, I remembered the clocks I learnt in Week 5. I set the circle groups to follow the circular path of the clock, but I didn't set the first circle group to appear at 1 o'clock.

I looked for a function that explains setInterval() in the course of writing the code. I did all the code with the help of Chatgbt.
